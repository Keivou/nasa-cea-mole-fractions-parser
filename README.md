# 🚀 NASA CEA PARSERS: Data Extraction Tools

This repository will house a collection of modular tools designed to simplify the post-processing of output files generated by the NASA CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) program.

I aim to take raw `.out` data and transform it into structured, usable formats for analysis and modeling.

## ✨ Future Tool Releases

This structure is designed to support multiple tools! I will eventually add more functionality for extracting energies, and probably update the mole-fractions-parser to also port the temperatures and pressures used.
